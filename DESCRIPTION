Description: Fits linear regression, logistic and multinomial regression models, Poisson regression, Cox model via Global Adaptive Generative Adjustment Algorithm.  
 For more detailed information, see Bin Wang, Xiaofei Wang and Jianhua Guo (2022) <arXiv:1911.00658>. 
 This paper provides the theoretical properties of Gaga linear model when the load matrix is orthogonal. 
 Further study is going on for the nonorthogonal cases and generalized linear models.
